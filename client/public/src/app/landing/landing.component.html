  <p>Welcome to my humble portfolio. It is very much a work in progress at this point.</p>
  <p>Primarily this is currently a place to show off polygon battle.</p>
  <p>A game built in javascript utilizing the html canvas.</p>
  <p>I hope you take the time to play with it and enjoy.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Thank you!</p>
